SaMa-Arduino-Project-
=====================

 An arduino bot that when it detects motion it lights up and flickers and sends tweets to my account.
 Go to the http://www.arduino.cc/ to understand how to setup the electronics of your arduino.
 Check out this github accounts for http://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five for more projects and codes.I modified the code I sourced from this account.
 For ntwitter documentation got to https://www.npmjs.org/package/ntwitter.
 I created an app on http://dev.twitter.com to generate my ‘Consumer Key/Consumer Secret’ pair and ‘Access Token/Access Token Secret’ pair. This will gave the arduino the ability to tweet to my tweeter account.
